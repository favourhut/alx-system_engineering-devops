Here is a basic task in the system engineering repository
It contains taskes that sets us up to understad basic network setting

**To foster my understanding in the web infracstruture design**

here are answers to asked questions

=============================TASK ONE================================================
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

**What is a server?**

A server is a basic computer component which processes and stores data which can be access
uppon rewuest.

A server can either be in form of an hardware or software components and they run in in an OS design model.

**What is the role of the domain name**

A domain name is used to cloud an ip address for clients readability whic is more easier to memorize that random numerical values.

**What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com**
The type of dns record www is in foobar is an A record DNS record type. This is beacuse it points a domain name to its ip adress.

**What is the role of the web server**
The role of a web server is to store and process static web pages as result upon request from clients.

**What is the role of the application server**

An application server stores an process business logic upon request. Business logi here means all the algorithm, functions, and programs a sofware needs to display to make an application or web page functional.

**What is the role of the database**

A database is used to store data or information related to any aspect of business operations. It can be very large, depending on the opration is it intended to cary out.

**What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website**
What the server uses to communicate with the computer is the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). The browser send this reques to the server asking it to response with available web page of an ip.

**explaining what the issues are with this infrastructure**
The design in task one lacks many functionalities for security and efficiency.

**SPOF** The SPOF(Single Point of Failure) is when much load is being placed on a single server. That is, a design with only one sever running can experince server breakdown beacuse of high traffic. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic and also, there are no monitoring system

**Downtime when maintenance needed**
This type of design would definitely expereinced downtime during a maintenace schedule beacuse its server sould be
down and there would be no backup
