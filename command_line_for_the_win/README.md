**Here are the steps i followed to use the SFTP command-line tool.**

**NOTE: I did not uplaoded both png and jpg since the task only requested for either of them**
**My files are in PNG**

**Here are the steps I followed to use the SFTP command-line tool:

**First, I launched my terminal or command prompt application on my computer.

**Next, I used the following command to connect to the remote server:

sftp username@hostname

**I replaced username with my username on the remote server and hostname with the hostname or IP address of the server.

**Entering Password: I entered my password for the remote server.

**Once connected, I used the cd command to navigate to the directory where I wanted to upload or download files.

**I then used commands such as put to upload files to the remote server or get to download files from the server to my local machine.

**After completing my file transfers, I closed the SFTP session by typing exit or quit.

By following these steps, I could effectively use the SFTP command-line tool to transfer files securely between my local machine and a remote server
